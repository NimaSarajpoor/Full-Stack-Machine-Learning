As installing everything needed for full stack ML is non-trivial (and an entire discipline in and of itself!), we have built Metaflow Sandboxes, which give you access to all the infrastructure you need for free. 
**Questions:** <br>
(1) How to create a full stack ML sandbox? <br>
(2) Maybe understand these terms and how they come to one picture: 
Metaflow Sandbox is a free, cloud-based development environment for ML and data-intensive applications, powered by open-source Metaflow. Behind the browser-based VSCode interface, it includes a scalable Kubernetes-based compute cluster, a Metaflow UI, an S3-based datastore, a metadata service, and workflow orchestration systems.
